# Question 1
# Given a list of filenames, we want to rename all the files with extension hpp to the extension h.
# To do this, we would like to generate a new list called newfilenames, consisting of the new filenames.
# Fill in the blanks in the code using any of the methods youâ€™ve learned thus far, like a for loop or a list comprehension.

filenames = ["program.c", "stdio.hpp", "sample.hpp", "a.out", "math.hpp", "hpp.out"]
# Generate newfilenames as a list containing the new filenames
# using as many lines of code as your chosen method requires.

newfilenames = []
for index, elements in enumerate(filenames):
    if elements[-3:] == "hpp":
        elements = elements.replace("hpp", "h")
        newfilenames.append(elements)
    else:
        newfilenames.append(elements)


print(newfilenames) 
# Should be ["program.c", "stdio.h", "sample.h", "a.out", "math.h", "hpp.out"]
